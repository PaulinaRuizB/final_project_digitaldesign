## Description:

This project implements a basic brushless DC (BLDC) motor controller using Verilog HDL. It is designed for educational purposes as part of the Digital Design course, focusing on core concepts such as PWM signal generation, state machines, and control logic for motor phase switching.

## Objectives:
- Implement a digital controller for a 3-phase brushless DC (BLDC) motor using Verilog.
- Design a PWM generator to control motor speed digitally.
- Apply digital design principles such as modularity, timing control, and simulation testing.
- Gain practical experience in hardware description languages and motor control logic.

# Simulations files

## Description:
This folder contains all simulation executables generated after compilation, they could be for individual module testing or complete system implementation.

## How they work?
As long as you are on the project main folder, after compiling, just type 'vvp simulations/(file_name)' to run the simulation. In case the module is not installed simply run 'sudo apt install vvp'.
